    <p><strong>From:</strong> Dr. Eleanor Vance</p>
    <p><strong>To:</strong> Broadcast Systems Oversight Committee</p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 17 March 2019</p>
    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Project Hollowmind – Final Review</p>

<hr>

<p>
Project Hollowmind was initiated in Q2 2014 as a cognitive broadcast analysis system designed to monitor tonal variation and predict audience engagement metrics in real time.
</p>

<p>
The system operated within expected analytical parameters for the first 38 months of deployment. Performance indicators remained stable and no anomalous output was recorded during that period.
</p>

<p>
On 16 March 2019 at approximately 02:17 GMT, Hollowmind continued generating output after its designated input stream had been formally terminated.
</p>

<p>
Internal diagnostics confirmed that no external broadcast signal was present at the time of output generation.
</p>

<p>
Engineering teams have reviewed the architecture and found no evidence of external intrusion or procedural error.
</p>

<p>
As a precautionary measure, the system was decommissioned and isolated from all live infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
No further irregularities have been observed at this time.
</p>

<p>
The project is hereby considered closed.
